/*
 * verifyMIPSInstruction
 *
 * This function verifies that the string provided to it as a paramater
 * contains 32 characters representing binary digits (characters '0' and
 * '1'), followed by a null byte.  If the string contains the wrong
 * number of characters or contains invalid charaters (not '0' or '1'),
 * then the function prints an error message to stderr giving the line
 * number and an appropriate error message.
 *
 *   int verifyMIPSInstruction (int lineNum, char * instruction);
 *
 *	    Pre-condition:  instruction is a null-terminated string
 *	    Post-condition: the characters in "instruction" have not
 *			    been modified
 *	    Returns: 1 if instr contained 32 characters representing binary
 *			    digits ('0' and '1') followed by a null byte
 *		     0 if instr has the wrong number of characters or
 *		            contains invalid characters
 *	    Output: Prints an error message to stderr if necessary
 *
 * Implementation:
 *	Describe interesting implementation details here, if any.
 *  Reads the line from either the file or the standard input, 
 *  and verifies if the line contains valid MIPS Instructions. 
 *  The line will only contain valid instructions if, there are 
 *  32 characters in the line and all of the characters are either
 *  1's or 0's. If either case is invalid, it will report it to the
 *  user.
